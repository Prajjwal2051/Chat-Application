''' 
Implements a simple chat server where multiple clients can connect, send messages, and receive messages from 
others in real time using TCP sockets

# import required modules
import socket       # for making a low level netwroking interface

# now i will provide the server host and port for the communication

PORT=57815  # we can use any port for our use cases
LISTENER_LIMIT=5
active_clients=[]   # list contains all active clients

# function to handel client

here we are using the client object we get from the server.accept()
